Lord of my love, whose merit has ensured that I will serve you loyally, I send this written message to you to demonstrate my devotion, not my intellectual skills – devotion so vast that my skill seems bare and meaningless by comparison, because I can’t find the words to express it. I nevertheless retain the hope that some imaginative inspiration deep in your heart will bestow some meaning on my completely bare love. Only when whichever star that guides my actions looks on me with a benign and gracious blessing, and puts clothes on my ragged love so that I will appear worthy of your respect, will I dare to proclaim my love for you. Until then I dare not reveal myself for you to put it to the test.
